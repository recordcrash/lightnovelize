Example outputs:
Oil painting of a sea captain with a rugged face, gray beard, and deep-set blue eyes, standing on a wooden ship's deck. He wears a weathered tricorn hat and a dark blue coat. Pointing towards the horizon, a large white whale breaches the water. The crew, men and women of diverse descent with various hair colors and styles, hustle around him, readying harpoons and adjusting sails. Some wear striped shirts, others don vests and bandanas.

Illustration of a Victorian-era detective with sharp aquiline features, curly black hair, and piercing green eyes. He plays a wooden violin, dressed in a tailored charcoal suit with a distinctive deerstalker hat. Beside him, his taller companion, with sandy brown hair and gentle blue eyes, reads a broadsheet newspaper. He sports a beige waistcoat and a cravat. The room they're in has dim lighting, with intricate wallpapers, a magnifying glass on a table, and antique wooden furniture.

Watercolor painting of a woman with long, curly brown hair and hazel eyes, wearing an elegant white gown with lace details, dancing with a tall man with short black hair and dark brown eyes. He's dressed in a tailored black tailcoat, white shirt, and a cravat. They dance gracefully in a grand ballroom with golden chandeliers. Surrounding them are onlookers in regency-era attire, with women in pastel dresses and men in waistcoats, all whispering and gazing at the dancing pair.

Photo-style depiction of a nervous man with lanky build, messy red hair, and wide brown eyes, riding a black horse through a fog-covered forest. He wears a simple white shirt and brown trousers. Constantly looking behind him, he sees a shadowy figure without a head, draped in a tattered cloak, chasing him and holding a pumpkin that glows eerily in the dark.

No talk, just go.
